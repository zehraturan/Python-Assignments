# Covid-19_Risk

Estimating the risk of death from coronavirus. Write a program that;

Takes "Yes" or "No" from the user as an answer to the following questions :

Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? Variable → age

Do you have a severe chronic disease? Variable → chronic

Is your immune system too weak? Variable → immune

Set a logical algorithm using boolean logic operators (and/or) and use if-statements with the given variables in order to print out us a message : "You are in risky group"(if True ) or "You are not in risky group" (if False).

# Armstrong_Number.py

Find out if a given number is an "Armstrong Number".

An n-digit number that is the sum of the nth powers of its digits is called an n-Armstrong number. Examples :
371 = 33 + 73 + 13;
9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44;
93084 = 95 + 35 + 05 + 85 + 45.

Write a Python program that;
takes a positive integer number from the user,
checks the entered number if it is Armstrong,
consider the negative, float and any entries other than numeric values then display a warning message to the user.
