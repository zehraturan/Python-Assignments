# Password Reminder

Let's say; you left a message in the past that prints a password you need. To see the password you wrote, you need to enter your name and the program should recognize you.
Write a program that 

Takes the first name from the user and compares it to yours,
Then if the name the user entered is the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Joseph! The password is : W@12",
If the name the user entered is not the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Amina! See you later."

# Covid-19_Risk

Estimating the risk of death from coronavirus. Write a program that;

Takes "Yes" or "No" from the user as an answer to the following questions :

Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? Variable → age

Do you have a severe chronic disease? Variable → chronic

Is your immune system too weak? Variable → immune

Set a logical algorithm using boolean logic operators (and/or) and use if-statements with the given variables in order to print out us a message : "You are in risky group"(if True ) or "You are not in risky group" (if False).

# Armstrong_Number.py

Find out if a given number is an "Armstrong Number".

An n-digit number that is the sum of the nth powers of its digits is called an n-Armstrong number. Examples :
371 = 33 + 73 + 13;
9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44;
93084 = 95 + 35 + 05 + 85 + 45.

Write a Python program that;
takes a positive integer number from the user,
checks the entered number if it is Armstrong,
consider the negative, float and any entries other than numeric values then display a warning message to the user.

# Fibonacci_Number.py


Task : Create a list consisting of Fibonacci numbers from 1 to 55 using control flow statements.

The desired output is like :

fibonacci →  [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
