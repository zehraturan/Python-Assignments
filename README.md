# Password Reminder

Let's say; you left a message in the past that prints a password you need. To see the password you wrote, you need to enter your name and the program should recognize you.
Write a program that 

Takes the first name from the user and compares it to yours,
Then if the name the user entered is the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Joseph! The password is : W@12",
If the name the user entered is not the same as yours, print out such as : "Hello, Amina! See you later."

# Covid-19_Risk

Estimating the risk of death from coronavirus. Write a program that;

Takes "Yes" or "No" from the user as an answer to the following questions :

Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? Variable → age

Do you have a severe chronic disease? Variable → chronic

Is your immune system too weak? Variable → immune

Set a logical algorithm using boolean logic operators (and/or) and use if-statements with the given variables in order to print out us a message : "You are in risky group"(if True ) or "You are not in risky group" (if False).

# Armstrong_Number.py

Find out if a given number is an "Armstrong Number".

An n-digit number that is the sum of the nth powers of its digits is called an n-Armstrong number. Examples :
371 = 33 + 73 + 13;
9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44;
93084 = 95 + 35 + 05 + 85 + 45.

Write a Python program that;
takes a positive integer number from the user,
checks the entered number if it is Armstrong,
consider the negative, float and any entries other than numeric values then display a warning message to the user.

# Prime_number.py

Task : Write a program that takes a number from the user and prints the result to check if it is a prime number.

The examples of the desired output are as follows :

input →  19 ⇉ output : 19 is a prime number
input →  10 ⇉ output : 10 is not a prime number


# Fibonacci_Number.py

Task : Create a list consisting of Fibonacci numbers from 1 to 55 using control flow statements.

The desired output is like :

fibonacci →  [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]\

# Prime_Number2.py

Task : Print the prime numbers which are between 1 to entered limit number (n).

You can use a nested for loop.
Collect all these numbers into a list
The desired output for n=100 :

[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59,
61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

# Fizz_Buzz_Numbers.py

Task : Print the Fizz Buzz numbers.

Fizz Buzz is a famous code challenge used in interviews to test basic programming skills. It's time to write your own implementation.
Print numbers from 1 to 100 inclusively following these instructions:
if a number is multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of this number,
if a number is multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of this number,
for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz",
print the rest of the numbers unchanged.
Output each value on a separate line.

# Leap_Year.py

Task:

Find out if a given year is a "leap" year.

In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year; unless...
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not the leap years.
Write a Python program that prints such as "2020 is a leap year" if the given year by the user is a leap year, prints such as "2019 is not a leap year" otherwise.

# Letters_Count.py

Task:

Count the number of each letter in a sentence.
The department you work for undertook a project construction that makes word / text analysis. You are asked to calculate the number of letters or any chars in the sentences entered under this project.
Write a Python program that;
takes a sentence from the user,
counts the number of each letter of the sentence,
collects the letters/chars as a key and the counted numbers as a value in a dictionary.


Examples
Sample inputs	: hippo runs to us!	
Outputs :{'s': 2, 'r': 1, 't': 1, 'h': 1, 'n': 1, 
'i': 1, 'u': 2, 'o': 2, 'p': 2, ' ': 3, '!': 1}
